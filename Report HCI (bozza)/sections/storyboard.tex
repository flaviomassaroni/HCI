\subsection{The storyboarding process}
In this section, we delve into our storyboarding process, where we started transforming user insights and feedback into visual narratives.  These storyboards serve as a visual roadmap, presenting the features we chose to implement, aligned with user needs and preferences. These sketches are the first representations of the direction we intend for our project to take.
