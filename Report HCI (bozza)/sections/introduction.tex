\section{Introduction}
This report provides an overview of all the different phases approached in designing an interface for a fintech application, emphasizing the process of need finding, storyboarding, and prototyping.
It outlines our journey through each phase of the design process, starting with the need finding phase, during which we conducted interviews and gathered insights into users' financial experiences and preferences, leveraging LLMs to have an additional opinion. Subsequently, we moved to the storyboarding phase, where we translated user insights into tangible scenarios and interactions. Finally, we delved into the prototyping phase, where we transformed our conceptual designs into interactive prototypes for usability testing and refinement.
In the whole process, it is highlighted the central importance of incorporating user feedback in the iterative design practices, to end up with a final product reflecting its real-life foundation in the developed features and the design choices. We strived to craft an app interface that does more than just meet basic functionalities. Our approach centered on embracing forefront HCI principles, ensuring the interface both functionality and enjoyability, giving users the possibility to manage their finances gladly and effectively.
