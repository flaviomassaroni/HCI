Welcome to Co-Budget! Co-Budget is an iOS banking app designed to help users achieve shared financial goals with friends, family, or colleagues. With a focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Co-Budget ensures an intuitive, collaborative, and engaging user experience, allowing contributors to easily join forces, set financial targets, and track progress toward their goals.
Project Overview

Co-Budget was developed with the primary goal of facilitating shared saving by integrating principles of HCI to enhance usability, accessibility, and overall user experience. Our team prioritized the design process to ensure that interactions within the app feel natural and intuitive. From initial user research and prototyping to usability testing, Co-Budget is a product shaped by iterative design and user-centered methodologies.

**Human-Computer Interaction Focus**

Co-Budget’s design and functionality emphasize an HCI-first approach to make financial collaboration enjoyable and stress-free. The following principles guided the design:

-	**User-Centered Design:** 
Initial user research provided insights into user needs and behaviors when saving collaboratively. Co-Budget was developed to address these findings with simple, guided interactions.

- **Iterative Prototyping and Testing:** Throughout development, we created wireframes and interactive prototypes, collecting feedback at every stage to refine both usability and aesthetics.
  
- **Accessibility:** Co-Budget is designed to meet accessibility standards, featuring adjustable font sizes, high-contrast mode, and intuitive navigation.

- **Clear Visual Feedback:** Users receive immediate visual confirmation of actions, such as successful transactions, goal updates, and progress tracking, which helps reinforce the collaborative aspect of saving.

- **Goal-Oriented Motivators:** The app encourages engagement by using motivational nudges, such as notifications of progress and positive reinforcement messages when milestones are reached.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Co-Budget interface is designed for simplicity and ease of navigation. Our minimalistic, clean UI provides a welcoming and efficient user experience that reduces cognitive load. Key screens include:

-	**Dashboard:** Displays all shared goals, personal contributions, and the overall status of each goal.
 
-	**Goal Setup & Invitation:** Simple setup process to create new goals, set target amounts, and invite others.
 
- **Contribution Tracker:** Visual charts and breakdowns show individual and collective progress.
 
-	**Notifications & Alerts:** Keep users informed of milestone achievements, new contributions, and goal updates.

**Future Enhancements:**

While Co-Budget’s current version focuses on shared savings, we are working on additional features based on user feedback:

-	**Expense Splitting:** An option to allocate expenses after reaching the goal.
 
-	**Custom Notifications:** More control over frequency and types of notifications.
